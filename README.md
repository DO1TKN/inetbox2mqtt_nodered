# inetbox2mqtt_nodered
human interface to control Truma Combi heatings with node-red via inetbox2mqtt bridge.

On the left side the table shows values received from the heating. On the other side you can set values. If the heating sends out the new value, the new value is set.
Only the slider for temperature is looped bach to the receiving value. It will move also if you change the temperature with the original panel.
